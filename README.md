# Seb's Chat

Optionally *Seb's Send Stuff Safely, Simply, System* or SSSSSS 🐍

## What's in here?

The client and an optional server. 

The client is capable of encrypting and decrypting single JSON messages via the command line, so the server is not needed.

The server allows you to create messaging "groups" which pass messages between users. Key exchange will be added eventually.
